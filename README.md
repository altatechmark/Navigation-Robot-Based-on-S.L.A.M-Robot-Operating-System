# Navigation-Robot-Based-on-S.L.A.M-Robot-Operating-System
This is a ROS implemented SLAM on a 2 wheeled differential drive robot to map an unknown environment. The TAB Planner is used to navigate on the map and the map generated is then used for autonomous navigation using the ROS Navigation stack. Lidar is implemented for SLAM and Odometry using Rotary Encoders is also implemented.
